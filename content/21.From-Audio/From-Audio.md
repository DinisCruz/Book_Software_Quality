### Technical managers With Coding Skills!!!!

If you have technical managers with coding skills, it’s a waste of their talent if they’re not coding once they get promoted into a non-coding function like technical architect or business analyst or even manager.

One of the things they should be doing is they should actually be reviewing the tests that are written by the application that they are managing and the fact that they have technical skills and coding skills means they can do it so that is an asset that should be leveraged.

What they should be doing is that for every feature that they request or find a bug, they should be reviewing the tests that represent the fix for that particular feature. And if that’s not possible, that represents a gap in the current test environment, which needs to be addressed. So ideally what should happen is the test should be written in a DSL, which is domain specific language, which should be easy to read and should clearly describe the bug or feature that has been fixed.



### Hiring Games Developers

There’s a lot that the appsec industry can learn from gaming, because they really have spent a lot of time thinking about visualization, how to understand high complex sets of data, things about the maps they create, the kind of ways they map the games so that it is easy for the user to understand and can play it. I think there’s a lot of stuff we can learn from it.

They also have a lot of interesting attacks through the extra games business logic, which is something that we could learn from, too. And more importantly, they also have a lot of great hardware and that is designed for high levels of processing and graphical visualization stuff. So there’s a lot of interesting application security analysis that can be done using the games industry hardware and the software visualization and even concepts.

So I wonder how many of the companies actually hire games developers because as I have said, they are big assets to have and can add quite a lot of value.



### Hosted services source code

*Need for companies that provide hosted web services to also provide the source code for their apps.*

So this is the need for companies that provide hosted solutions of applications need to provide their source code of their applications, and they need to do it for three reasons.

One of them is to allow the offload hosting of their data and the easy backup and the restore of their data.

The second one is to allow the emergence of third party companies and people who also provide those hosting services which is going to make the platform much more robust and much more effective.

And then the third one is for security, so people can key review it and the security assessments etcetera.

And this is basically interesting, this is basically arguing that amazon should open their code, and again it doesn't need to be open source it could just be a license not basically to disclose the code. Although I do think that open source has a lot of advantages in terms of being able to contribute and use and taking the technology forward.

But, the concept is that for us to be able to trust this and to be able to use those and even somehow be able to consume it in multiple different places, we need it to be open, we need it to be in a way that it can be consumable. And that basically is I think a big step that companies need to have.

And in some ways, it is already happening. If you actually look at some of the companies that are doing that, I think there is already a bunch of examples of companies who kind of provide a service and then they open source it.

And I think you already have two variations, you have companies who start as a tool, let's say hosting a tool, a blog engine and then eventually the owners of it realize that they also should provide hosting services, and that is natural, the code starts open source and just be able to provide hosting service on top of it.

The other one is code that actually starts some ways internal applications and then people release the code someway for the reasons I have already mentioned above.

And in fact the other thing that can happen is what happened currently with Etherpad, where after they were bought, basically Google who bought them made a decision of releasing the source code in a way to allow that technology to live, and in a way not to piss their customers.

So I think that way we are looking it in terms of open sourcing is that how much interesting development where companies actually provide the source code of these hosting apps.


### On Ideas

So part of the reason why I am trying to do more blog posts like this and more documenting is that there is a very interesting phenomenon that happens that once you start documenting ideas or exploring a particular idea, other ideas come out of it.

And in some ways, out of the noise of all this bunch of brainstorming and basically big ideas, that someways the good ones actually arrive at the end.

And for now I was just thinking of an interesting idea and I just forgot what it was and it is really, really frustrating because it is a bit like this little bird you had in your hand that you just let it fly.

And now, if I can remember what happened, or what that idea was then I am never going to have it again, at least not on that format. And it is a really, really frustrating exercise because sometimes not that particular idea that was good it was the one that I was going to create from that or the one that would...to write a blog about it or I was actually going to start you know document it then that is how it works.

So, one of the things I have done tens of times especially as I go into this sort of static analysis well is that I write basically notebooks, I write notebooks after notebooks, after notebooks just literally ideas. Everything that comes to my head I just start writing it down.

And in some ways some really, really interesting and powerful ideas come out of it and it is usually like the third phase when the real stuff comes out and you really come up with really, really interesting and simple ideas and ways to actually address the problem.

And in some ways if you look at my work on O2 platform it is all about coming up with ideas to solve particular problems and exploring tens of different directions until you are actually able to really figure out what is actually happening. And basically what is the best way to solve a particular problem, and of course it all comes down to ideas.



### On Lack of automation on the web world

One of the interesting things that is happening with the current if you look at the web world, is that we have a tremendous lack of automation.

It is really sort of amazing how little automation exists on websites and between websites and between the stuff that I do and the materials that I consume.

For example, if I want to move data from one provider to the other, there isn't an easy way to describe how that should happen. If I want to make a bunch of actions on a particular website or a couple of modifications on a particular web page, you know it is almost things like cruise monkey are the only small examples of what needs to happen.

But, I think the problem is that because we don't have web automation, you don't have services providing around these automations. And we don't have basically a healthy promotion and a healthy model that promotes the development of tools, API protocols for enabling that automation of web assets.

We are going a bit on the right direction because by creating the whole web services and AJAX and dynamic sort of content by the semantic web, the separation of coding data that is all good but I think we need a much more focus on this kind of automation of web process.

In fact, I think there is a lot of interesting businesses that you can actually develop and services you can charge by just enabling that and providing that.


### Openness level of a company

In terms of how open a company is, so if a company all its intellectual property and assets are open, for example open like open source, surely then in terms of level of transparency you are going to start to increase that to the stuff that is produced internally.

So all documents, or internal documents could be made public and eventually all emails, at least let's say a particular email account could be made public. Because we already have twitter messages and all that stuff public and blog posts so that would just be an extension of it.

In some way, that will allow customers to figure out what is going on, gain more visibility to what is happening in that particular company. And in some ways, it probably would allow the company to scale a million places, scale much more comfortably in the open informative way.

_(after all there are already a number of non-authorized parties that have access to the data)_


### SAST market value ###

_Question - how big would the static analysis market be if it actually worked?_

So here is a question, how big would the application security, the static analysis world would be if it actually worked? If we were actually able to look at one app, scan it and get a really in depth analysis of what the app does, what are the security side effects and what needs to be re-mediated in some ways, different information about what needed to be re-mediated?

And in fact one could argue that even if you already had full blown good samples and full blown examples of what should be changed, it still will take a bit of a while to fix.

But someways the question is, how big would that market be? And I think it will be enormous, because ultimately once we can do that, we are actually looking at business intelligence straight into the eye. And we actually have a massive market in front of us, because theoretically every single app, every iphone app, every firefox app, every windows app, every shareware app needs to basically go through one of these reviews.
