**Using TDD To Test Frameworks Behavior**

It is key that a developer team understands the behaviors of the frameworks that they are using because the frameworks create such big realities and such big coding patterns and behaviors that it is important that they fully understand.

So usually use test environment as a way to kind of almost in a REPL kind of environment to test and check how the frameworks behave; what happens when you do this, what happens when you do that and what will happen with these inputs. 

And even better use that as an opportunity to learn how to test the framework, how to be able to get data in one end that comes up on the other end. 

And that is actually very, very effective because usually when you take a framework, a lot of frameworks are not easy to test or they are not easy to test in your current environment. 

So this will also push that nicely to a limit and find gaps in your test environment now and in the future.
