**TDD Can Be Just Like SVN**

What is interesting about users that us git is that most of the time at least at the moment-2016, they came from an environment where they were programming SVN before.

So, it is interesting because I am yet to meet a developer that says I want to go back to SVN, I want to basically go back to that world that existed before I was doing branches left right and center, before I had the power of git in my development.

So that is a really good interesting analogy because it is something that maybe in the beginning they still remember not fully understanding it, not fully understanding how it worked. And then especially that moment where probably somebody they knew they could say well everything you can do with Git I can do with SVN.

And you know in a lot of ways most of the common git usages can be replicated in SVN the problem is the speed and the work flows. The work flows that you have with git are just about impossible to do with SVN at least with the speed that you do them with git.

So the power of git is it changes your development practice. The way I look at it is if you are programming and you are trying to do TDD [Test Driven Development] and you don't have an environment where your tests run in real time, i.e. once you lift your hands off the key board the test is executing.

And you don't have real time code coverage shown on the ID, you basically are back in the SVN days. You code is as efficient as it was when you were doing the SVN stuff versus using Git.

So real time code coverage of tests and code coverage is basically the git of test driven development. And that makes a very good analogy because the developers understand their job is again the difference between VMWare and Docker they could still do the same thing but the work flows and the paradigms are completely different.

That is a good analogy to try to show to devs that you could be doing this but if you aren't doing this, then it is like you are doing SVN again.
