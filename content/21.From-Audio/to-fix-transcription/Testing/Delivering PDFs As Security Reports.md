**Delivering PDFs As Security Reports**

Delivering PDFs as security reports is probably the worst possible way to deliver security knowledge because what you have in those reports would tend to be these massive piles of stuff which tend to be crazy redundant once you've basically read a couple.

It is that they just have a shadow of an issue, they have a particular moment in time. And basically they are not reproducible. So they suck from a recipient because you get this thing you don't know if it is completely true or the real impact, or the real reasons of how to replicate that even if you could see the proof, there is all sorts of very important questions that can only be asked when you are actually able to replicate the problem.

So what you want is basically to receive tests. So instead of PDFs what you really want to get is the ability to replicate what the pen test has actually found. Which is also why you really want to give the pen test access to a source code because you want them to have figured out where and how to get to a particular location.

So ultimately it is about saving time, it is about giving a good way for the developers to know where the problem is and even more importantly to be able to replicate the issue and when they fix it to confirm that it has been fixed because that test shouldn't fail.

And this is what the tests or the pen test should be delivering so instead of really reports they should be delivering tests. They should be passing tests because what they do is they show that a particular behavior is possible. Whether that is to be fixed as soon as possible or later or sometime in the future or never that is actually a business decision not in a way a security decision.
