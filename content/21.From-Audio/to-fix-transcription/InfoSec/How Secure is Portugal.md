### How Secure is Portugal?

How secure and safe are Portuguese companies and infrastructures?

Portugal today is a very digital country, and most Portuguese companies are basically software companies. If you look at how they operate, all of them are in software and are controlled by software.

So, the question is, how secure are they? How safe are they? By 'secure' I mean how well can they sustain an attack? How well can they detect and react to a possible attack on their digital infrastructure? What is the probability of an attack happening in the short term?

Although these are contradictory concepts, my thesis is that Portugal is both highly insecure, and also, for the moment, quite safe.

Portugal is safe is because there are not enough attackers targeting the current insecurities of the system. This will probably remain the case for the next couple of years. The problem is what happens after that, when the criminals improve their business models and start to really focus on Portuguese assets.

I would argue that Portugal has already been a victim of certain kinds of financial manipulation. If you look at what happened during the financial crisis, a substantial part of it was artificially created by the markets. The markets pushed the Portuguese economy really hard and made a lot of money by betting that Portugal was going to struggle, and would continue to struggle, in the financial markets.

If you look at Portuguese companies, and you look at the size of the AppSec industry in Portugal, you see that it is comparatively small. There are very few Portuguese companies with public AppSec teams. The market for security companies is very small, and while there are a couple of interesting pen testing companies, you don't see a lot of activity in that space.

The creation of an AppSec infrastructure is a direct consequence of being attacked. After an attack, companies create AppSec teams and hire security experts. If anything, Portugal is currently exporting security experts. I know a lot of great Portuguese AppSec and InfoSec specialists in the UK. 

The problem is security experts aren't being recruited to Portugal. At the moment, countries like the UK, that are more evolved in AppSec, are recruiting, but Portugal should be hiring AppSec talent.

The reality is the Portuguese AppSec industry isn't very mature. The question is, does Portugal want to be like the rest of Europe and be caught in the crossfire? Or does it want to be proactive, and actually create an industry which could become very powerful, very effective, and very profitable for Portugal, and could also help to secure Europe and help the world?
