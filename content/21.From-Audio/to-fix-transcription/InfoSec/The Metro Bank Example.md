### The Metro Bank Example

Metro Bank is a new high street bank that opened in the UK in 2010. Its buildings are brand new, with facilities designed to create an attractive environment for customers. The analogy I would like to make in relation to security assessments in AppSec is this: Imagine that you, or investors, or regulators, want to know how secure Metro Bank is. This is a perfectly legitimate question to ask.

In AppSec, we let them build the whole building with everything in it and then we hire some 'local detectives' to test the security of 'the building'.

Frequently, the best that they can say is, "Oh look, your security guards are okay, when I went in there they kept an eye on me, I wasn't able to pass. I wasn't able to trick the tellers", and so on.

So, you have passed the first security test,  but does this mean that you know the security of the money that goes into the bank is actually any good? Of course you don't know, because that isn't how you expect those things to occur.

What you expect is for someone to have access to the plans, and to have a full understanding of the security, which you can then review, and assess where security can be improved.

It is the same thing when effective, professional criminals plan an attack on a physical, or a virtual, security system. They will resemble the criminals in the movie Ocean's Eleven.  They will find so much information that you get a sense that they know more about the system than the guys who designed it themselves. This is how they always find the blind spots in a security system.

So, when you do a security assessment on applications, give the person doing the assessment all the necessary information: the full source code, access to developers, threat models, all your risks, all your current understanding. If you don't give them this information, you are selling yourself short. You are asking the wrong question, so don't be disappointed if you get the wrong answer.
