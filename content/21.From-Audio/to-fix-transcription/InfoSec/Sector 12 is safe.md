### Sector 12 is safe

There is a great CA ad [^ca-advert] that shows security men chasing an intruder through an office building. When they are almost about to catch him, the intruder crosses a line from sector 12 into sector 13. The security men stop running, and one of them radios, "Sector 12 is now secure".

This is a typical example of how a particular application, or a particular team, will only focus on their own area. If they discover issues that cross into another area or affect another organization, they will ignore them. Like the ad says, their area is now secure, and they have been encouraged not to follow-up on anything beyond their remit.

We are doing the opposite. We want companies to realize they are all in bed together. They need to collaborate, and they need to be open. When you open a risk register, you should be encouraged to open issues on other people's teams.
