### Portugal as a Leader in AppSec

Portugal could be a leader in AppSec. Throughout Portugal's history, there were times when Portugal provided the leading innovators and ground-breaking researchers in navigation, in maritime research, and exploration.

In the same way that Portugal navigated the seas in the past, Portugal should now be leaders in navigating the code. Portugal should hold the keys to the door of code.

Portuguese researchers are pushing the envelope, challenging the world, being innovative, and they are doing things that others aren't doing just because they can. They are following this great history of leading important change and discovery.

Code is more and more important. Code controls Portugal, and so software controls Portugal. The problem is, Portugal controls very little of the software it uses. I think it is time for Portugal to take control of the software. I think this should be a strategic and key objective of both Portuguese companies and the Portuguese government.

Of course you can replace Portugal with any other country in the world, especially any European country. But I am Portuguese so I have a soft spot for Portugal, but I also know that Portugal has exceptional talent, exceptional AppSec people that could make this happen. What we need is focus and determination.
