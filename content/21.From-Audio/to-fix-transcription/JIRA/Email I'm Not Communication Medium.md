### Email is not an official communication medium

Emails are conversations, they are not official communication mediums. In companies, there is a huge amount of information and decisions that are only communicated using emails, especially relating to risks, actions needed, non-functional requirements, and re-factoring. These things tend to only exist on an email thread or on a document in the middle of nowhere. That is not good enough. Email is just noise, and once something goes into an email it is often very difficult to find it again.

If information isn't included on the wiki page, if it is not on a virtual control system, it basically doesn't exist. It is especially important not to communicate security risks in email. It is not good enough to say to a manager, "By the way, here is something I am worried about". You have to create and send a ticket to the manager. This will allow you to track the situation, the information, the responses; in short, you can track exactly what is going on. This approach also gets around the problem of someone moving on in their company or their career. Their knowledge of a particular issue remains behind for someone else to use if they need to.  

Emails are not a way to communicate official information; they are just a nice chat, and they should be understood as such. Important official information, in my view, should be hyperlinked. The hyperlinkability of a piece of information is key, because once it has a hyperlinked location, you can point others to it, and a track record is created. The way I look at it, if information is not available on the hyperlink, it doesn't exist.
