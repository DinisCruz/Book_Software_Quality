### Sharing is a Very Emotional and Dangerous Practice

As someone who likes to share a lot of information, I have a very personal experience of what it feels like when you share data, especially in environments that don't promote, or reward, the sharing of information, whether that is a screen shot, a document, or an idea.

Many companies don't promote sharing, and as a result knowledge doesn't get transmitted. This is a highly inefficient way to work.

When I publish something online, I usually use a kind of 'shitometer' scale to measure reaction to my post. The scale ranges from a couple of hours, to a day, to a week. If there isn't a massive allergic reaction to what I've published within three hours, that means my content can't be that bad. 

If within a day there have been no complaints, it means that the other side has lost the moral authority to complain, and after a week without complaints I consider the cat to be out of the bag. Anyone who objects after a week can't argue that I shouldn't have shared, because they had enough time to complain, but they didn't.

My problem is, why is sharing even a problem? Ideally, you should be able to share without thinking. When you think about the possible consequences of sharing, what can happen is you think about how you may not be rewarded for sharing. You are more likely to be rewarded for maintaining the status quo.

This can be quite difficult, because by sharing certain information you can jeopardize a friendship or a business relationship. Nobody wants to alienate a company or a business partner.  You may have more important things to worry about in your life or in your work than fighting that particular fight.

I believe that one of the jobs of management is not only to promote sharing, and reward the people that share, but also to share themselves. I always find that when I am in a team the more I share, the more other members share because they think, "Well, if that guy can get away with sharing that information, then I can get away with sharing too". My sharing gives cover to others, and a positive cycle, where sharing creates more sharing, is created.

Of course you can also have a negative cycle where nobody shares, or if somebody shares something and gets punished for it, nobody will ever share anything again.

Ultimately, what we want is a situation where the sharing of information is promoted, so we can all learn from each other. The lack of agenda is one of the main advantages of the open model. In an open and creative world, you know things can be shared, and there is already an implicit license to share. 

A license gives you the ability to do something, so you don't have to ask permission and that is the key. That is why collaboration happens a lot more even within a company when you have open licenses.
