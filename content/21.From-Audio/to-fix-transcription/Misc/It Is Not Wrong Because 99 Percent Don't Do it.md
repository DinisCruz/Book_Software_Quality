### An Idea isn't Wrong Because 99 Percent don't Accept it

It is very important to have confidence in your ideas and to have a fact-based approach to life and knowledge, even if the majority of people doesn't like or accept your ideas.

The way I look at it, as long as your ideas don't harm others, you should pursue those ideas. A lot of people have died and suffered in the past for you to be able to enjoy freedom of thought and expression, so you might as well honour them and persevere with your ideas.

A good example for me is, a number of years ago a good friend of mine recommended a book called, "Born to Run". As a result of reading the book, my friend had started to walk barefoot. I read the book, I really liked it, I looked at the science behind it, and realized the science had a sound basis. I tried walking barefoot too, and I enjoyed it.

I have now been walking barefoot for four years, and it's great. I go barefoot on the road, in airports, through the city, and in restaurants. Initially, there was definitely a social element that I had to negotiate, but what helped me to overcome any obstacles was the idea that walking barefoot was healthy, it was good for me, I enjoyed it, and why shouldn't I be able to do it? 

The same approach applies when working in code, or in business.  If you have ideas, and you believe in those ideas, you should pursue them. You should persevere, even though you know most people will not understand where you are coming from. Sometimes you will have to deal with the curse of knowledge, where you have made a number of paradigm shifts, but the people around you haven't.  You are thinking on a different plane, which is where magic occurs, and where all the interesting things happen. 

So, be confident in your ideas and remember you are playing a long game. There are a lot of people who pursued their ideas for many years before enjoying an 'overnight success'. Sometimes you need to work on something for ten, twenty, even thirty years before it becomes something that is valuable and usable by more people. But that's life.
