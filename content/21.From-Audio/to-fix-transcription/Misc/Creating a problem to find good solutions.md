### Creating a Problem to Find Good Solutions

One of my favourite ways to solve a difficult problem is to put myself, or my team, in a situation where we have to solve the problem. This approach forces us to understand what is going on, and it forces us to think how we will address the problem. By doing this we are not thinking theoretically about a particular issue. We are dealing with a real problem with real scenarios, real outcomes, and real feedback.

The closer you can be with the problem you are solving, the more you can experience, the more you can visualize, and the better the solution you will devise. 

How many times have you heard of cases where a particular feature was no sooner added to an application than one of the key engineers went on the road, met some customers, and when they gave some feedback the engineer realised, "Ooh, that isn't working as well as it could, I can do something better".

That is a ridiculously late stage to receive that kind of feedback. You want those feedback loops much closer to home because you want to be solving the right problems.

That is why feedback loops are so important. The faster the feedback loop you have, the easier it is to understand the implications of changes, and the easier it is to find good solutions for the problems you are trying to solve. This also prevents over-engineering and over-complexity.
