### Open-source agenda

Whether somebody open-sources their code or not says a lot about their underlying agenda. In fact, one of the powers of open-sourcing code is that it removes a whole number of possible ways the maker of the code can control what happens in the future.

Not knowing the agenda is one of my fundamental issues with products, or code that isn't open-sourced. Somebody might turn and say, "here is some code, here is some app, please use them", but I don't know what they will do with it in the future.

A lot of companies like the idea of not open-sourcing, because it allows them to reserve the right to say, "Oh, I might close this and sell this one day". This means you are locked into their technology, you are locked into their product or data. You have just made an investment in a product that might ultimately be out of your control. 

That is why, for me, open-sourcing a product, or open-sourcing technology, is base camp. It is the beginning of a long journey to create a vibrant community of developers, contributors, and users who can collaborate in the creation of a particular application or software.
