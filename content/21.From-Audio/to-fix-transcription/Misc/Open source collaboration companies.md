### Open source collaboration companies

The reason companies need to embrace open-source as a development strategy is because internally, when multiple teams have to work together, they need to establish common ground where collaboration can take place.

One of the key elements of multi-team collaboration is identifying who controls the components. One of the reasons why there is so much reinventing of the wheel is not because teams don't know what is going on, or they don't want to work with someone they don't know. It is because of struggles for control and power.

For example, imagine that a team in your company is developing an authorization model. If they are the only ones maintaining that model, and if they are the only ones who are able to modify that model, then you have created a bottleneck. A power dynamic now exists where that particular team now controls the other teams that use the authorization model.

Of course this gets political very quickly. All it takes for possible conflict to arise is for one team to want to go faster than the other teams. Because of this, sometimes it is easier, faster, and cheaper for a particular team to develop something by themselves, than to use a shared module.

However, if that same module was open-source, then the implication of a fork, or of re-using a particular version, would be much easier to do. In fact, it would imply that when you take someone else's code, you fork it, and then you commit back the things that should be on the main repository.

If you don't, then you have what is called the open-source tax, where you have to maintain whatever changes are made to the upstream with the changes you made in your own fork.

So, ironically, even at company levels, and especially in bigger companies, open-source is one of the ways to promote team collaboration. Team collaboration is very important when you have companies who buy all sorts of other companies whose systems then need to be integrated. 

You often end up in a situation where every one of the products acquired has specific modules. They have all got a security signature, they all have their own dedication, authorization, validation, their own way of storing data, and so on.

Instead of having common labels or common integration among those things, every team fights to control a particular part of the application. The teams are thinking pragmatically: if they don't have some components to maintain, the size of the team will be effected.

The team will lose developers and get smaller. In a way, teams are asked to collaborate with the idea that they will lose out, and will become less powerful if they collaborate.

Of course, this guarantees that this kind of collaboration won't happen. I do not suggest that people will avoid it on purpose, but they won't proactively integrate. This is why some companies struggle when they acquire other companies and try to create products that work together. There isn't a strong desire to collaborate, because the company development strategy isn't designed in a way that promotes collaboration. Open-source, on the other hand, does encourage collaborative integration.

Ultimately, companies need to look at their products and understand what parts need to be open-source, and what parts should be propitiatory. Propitiatory concessions should be strictly limited.
