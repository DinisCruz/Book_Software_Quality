 ### Docker Research Teams Need to be Empowered.

Docker teams within a company form an important part of the future of the company.  In many companies, junior developers are allocated to Docker projects, but they realize that containers in that model actually are key for a lot of companies. 

In a way those developers should be in a kind of 'mission from God' mindset. They should be on a mission to solve the company's problems; they should be empowered, rewarded, high-profile, and they should have a mandate from the top to break barriers, to try things, to figure out how things are.

Both the Docker teams and the company need to understand that their job is to be disruptive, their job is to prove how it works, so they must be given the best possible outcomes. It is critical that they also get a budget to do their work. 

They should be trustworthy. They should know not to go crazy, but they should be trusted to do what it takes in order to solve a particular problem within the company.

Let's say the Docker has to figure out how to containerize applications, how to actually make the development environment more productive, and how to go all the way to production where you can actually run in a Docker environment.

Regardless of whether the Docker gets used in production in the short term, just doing the exercise will solve a huge amount of problems. It will make sure that the dependencies are understood, and it will create a much better development environment for a lot of companies.
