### On Ideas

Part of the reason I am trying to write more blog posts like this is that a very interesting phenomenon happens once I start documenting ideas or exploring a particular idea; I find that new and really interesting ideas emerge from the noise of all the general brainstorming.

Just now I was thinking of an interesting idea but I've forgotten what it was. This is really frustrating; it is as though I had a little bird in my hand and I just let it fly away.

Now, if I can remember the idea at all, I won't remember it in the same precise detail or format. This frustrates me because that particular idea might have led to other ideas, and I was going to blog about it, document it and explore how it might work, but now I can't.  

To avoid this happening too often, one of the things I have done many times, especially as I start this sort of static analysis, is that I fill notebooks with my ideas. I make a note of everything that comes into my head.

Sometimes really interesting and powerful ideas come out of my writing. Usually, when I am developing an idea, I come up with some really interesting and simple new ideas and new ways to address problems I might have. 

If you look at my work on the O2 platform, it is all about coming up with ideas to solve particular problems, and exploring in different directions until I can really figure out what is happening. This, for me, is the best way to solve a particular problem, and it all comes down to exploring ideas through writing.
