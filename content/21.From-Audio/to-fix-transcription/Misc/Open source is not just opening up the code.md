### Open-source is not just opening up the code

When companies decide to open-source, they aren't just embracing the idea that the code is released and the license is open-source. They are also embracing a collaborative culture. They embrace the idea that the companies should be collaborative, that teams should send codes among each other, they should share their knowledge, and they should push the boundaries. The companies also embrace the idea of their code and their actions being peer-reviewed.

One of the common characteristics of open-source is that there is a much bigger duty of care by all parties involved. The concept alone of open-source makes people take extra care, and forces them to pay much closer attention to detail and quality. People want to make sure things are done properly, in a way that is easy to consume.

One of the untold benefits of open-source is that it allows for products to be installable and deployable for a wider audience sooner rather than later.

You don't encounter packages that only work in a particular box or a particular computer; teams get exposed earlier to the problem of having multiple people with multiple systems in multiple environments actually consuming that particular application.

Ultimately, open-source is a way to promote environments that are much more collaboration-friendly at code level. It isn't just about license, it isn't just about dropping something and giving instructions for it to be copied. Where companies have done this, nothing happened, because open-source is about a community. Open-source is about creating communities, and that is difficult to achieve.
