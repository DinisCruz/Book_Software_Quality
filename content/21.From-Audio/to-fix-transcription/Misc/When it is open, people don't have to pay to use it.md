### When it is open, people don't have to pay to use it

When you make a piece of software or information open, you lose the right to control how it is used. An interesting reaction sometimes occurs when people release a piece of software or information. They get annoyed when they receive no payment for its use, and they seem to think that users are obliged to pay.

Part of the game of course is that you don't have to pay to use, which is why it is open and free.

The lack of a good model to pay for software or content that is free is a problem in our current software development environment. The people responsible for creating the open content aren't able to make a living from that work. 

As a society we need to figure out ways to reward, to pay, and to channel funds and capabilities to the people who do specific work and maintain specific pieces of software.
