### Bono’s Comments on the Music Industry

I think it was in Time Magazine or in a New York Times article, Bono wrote about his wish list or predictions for 2010. In it he made a claim that the lack of copyright protection mainly damages the little guys, where the big guys like him actually get protected. 

I don’t really buy that argument, because I think the little guys have always been screwed by the music industry, which tries to exploit them as much as possible until, like Bono, they grow big enough to get contracts. In fact, the music industry used to be so bad that I found out, in the 80s, some of the contracts were considered to be unenforceable. When a judge actually looked at the contracts, he said, “There’s no way you guys can do this.”

I don’t think the music industry has any credibility when it claims that the privacy and the lack of copyright protection on music actually damages the little guys. I think that’s still to be proven. 

I also think the little guys can now be much more proactive and dynamic about what they do. I remember reading an article, I think it was in the early 2000s, about how the real way to sell music online is to test if it's the easiest way for the little guy to sell and buy music. In some ways, this is what iTunes did. iTunes basically realized a price that was reasonably decent, and brought the little guys' music to the masses. 

What the music industry has failed to capitalize on is the fact that fans like me would buy many more products than are currently available.  I would happily spend a lot more money on bands I like, but the music industry only sells albums, maybe once or twice a year.  I will buy the album if I like the band and if I liked their previous albums, but the industry could be much sharper, and could sell me a lot more products.  This is what the Guitar Hero guys did, because they were able to leverage a lot more revenue streams from their music.
