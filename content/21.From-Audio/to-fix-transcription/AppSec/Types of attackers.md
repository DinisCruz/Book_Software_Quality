**Types of Attackers**

There are a number of different types of attacks that can hit your organization. The most important differential is whether they are opportunistic or focused attacks. 

An opportunistic attack happens when you are in the wrong place at the wrong time [in terms of the internet] and you use a particular framework, or technology, or you are close to something, or you may even have a personal relationship with one of the attackers; any of these variables can make you vulnerable to an opportunistic attack.

A focused attack occurs when you are targeted by specific attackers because they are going after your business or your type of business.

The next element to consider is whether the attackers have a criminal business model or not. There are some very sophisticated, state-sponsored, or activist attackers, but the reality is the greatest damage is caused by criminals, kids and script kiddies -- less experienced attackers who are not really a problem in the medium term. 

They can cause short-term damage, but ultimately, if the attacker tells you about it, he is a friend. It doesn't matter how much short term pain that gives you, the reality is that the consequences of an attacker actually exploiting an issue with criminal intent would be way worse.

The ones you have to really worry about are the criminals who have criminal business models. They have a system, they invest in their system, they are persistent, and they are focused on finding ways to make money from your business.

It is like Murphy's law: anything that can go wrong will go wrong. A targeted attack is malicious, it adapts, it reacts, it has multiple levels of activities. I have seen cases where three different teams work on an attack. One team carries out log in and password attacks to discover names and passwords and make sure they work. Another team will know how to use the names and passwords, and the third team knows how to get the money out of the system.  

So if you happen to be positioned in one of those chains, you are in trouble because then the attackers will focus on your activities.
