**Why SAST rules need to be customized**

It is very important to customize static analysis engines because we need to teach the tools where resources and assets are, what matters, and what we really want to know.

Customizing rules allows the people who understand the application to indicate the areas of real concern. This eventually gives you highly defensible, and highly robust, results that are actionable when they occur.

By not allowing customization, by making it difficult, or by ignoring the importance of customization, the tools promote the idea that one click of a button will do the job, which of course is not the case. Not allowing customization undermines the quality and the value of those engines' capabilities.
