**Information Security and Uses.**

Information security tends to have a really bad attitude towards users. They blame users for doing things that are insecure, in the same way that health and safety complains that people do things, and doing things puts them in danger.

The fundamental logic is that security is there to empower users. In fact, security is there to allow the users to go faster, which is the same analogy used to explain the purpose of brakes in cars. So, for example, if users, or developers who are also IT users, run their desktops with admin privileges, this creates a fundamental apps InfoSec problem.

I don't mean that the user shouldn't be doing this. I mean that the user should be given alternatives to do their day job productively   without needing admin rights. Or they should be given solutions that don't require them to need admin rights.

These days, with virtualization, it is easier and faster to get around this issue if someone wants to do something, or install something, that requires specific admin privileges. You can now give them a VM, a machine they can desktop into remotely. The VM is totally isolated, much more protected, but also disposable and dis-countable. The VM also gives the user access to the assets that the normal user gets exposed to.

The idea is that if a problem occurs and something gets compromised, and the user really will need admin privileges, the problem is self-contained. Of course it isn't held in our current IT infrastructure and development software, or, we have got admin privileges and a lot of them require extra privileges, but that doesn't mean that we implement solutions to isolate that.

So, while  the InfoSec guys can sometimes have a bad attitude about the users,  the same thing can happen in AppSec, where the AppSec guys can speak critically about the developers' work. It is very easy to complain about bad code and 'stupid' decisions, when one doesn't have the pressures and deadlines that the developers have to deal with.

In my book, developers tend to be very clever, they have double the knowledge because the problems they deal with don't originate with them but with the ecosystem and the environment that they are coding in, and they have to manage all of this.
