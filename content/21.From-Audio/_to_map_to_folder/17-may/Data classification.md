### Data classification.

Every data that exists in an organization especially on applications need to have a classification for its value which is what is usually called data classification.

So, this means that we need to know if a particular piece of data is sensitive then, where is it going to be used, what is the value of it for the business?

And usually, the best way to determine that is to ask for a particular set of data, what will happen if it was disclosed? What will happen if it was put on paste bin or modified? And that is always a good question because then you start to understand the value of that. 

Most companies tend to have data classification in terms of business, so Infosec data classification, but you also need Appsec Mapping. So, you need to understand, is this a password? Is this mission critical? Is this something that will end up being displayed on the user? Is this a legal contract?. Basically, is this a piece of information that has value and needs to be protected?
