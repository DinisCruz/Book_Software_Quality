## Book structure

The structure of the book is still in a big state of flux.

The current phase is the 'brain dump' mode, where I'm putting down a large number of ideas so that I don't lose them.

<<<<<<< HEAD
In terms of how the content should be presented, my current thinking is that it should be organized in two main parts

 - Part I - The solution (testing)
 - Part II - The problem (software insecurity/quality)

This way if the reader is already aware of the problem (and is asking the question 'How do I solve it?') he can focus on the important message/concept of the book (ideas on how to solve our current Quality/AppSec problem).

If the reader is still on the 'Why is this important?' phase, then he can start with Part II which will hopefully convince him of the problem.




### Who is this book not for

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is not a book for the teams that are currently writing secure and quality code

This is about doing appsec for the rest. It's about scale and how to do it for the companies/teams that don't have a large appsec security team or budget

The good news it that we have solved the problem, and know how to write secure and quality code.

```Add Alex Stamos reference that 450 of 500 Fortune 500 are in a terrible shape (i.e no appsec teams)
```


### What question are you asking? (on AppSecc)

on AppSec/Quality:

- "Why should I do it?"
- "How do I do it?"
- "What does it look like when I'm doing it effectively?"

### Start with Why

- map AppSec to 'Start with Why' concept/presentation/book
