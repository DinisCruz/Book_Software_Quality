## Leanpub book, based on "New Era of Software with modern Application Security" presentation

This book explores the ideas originally developed in my "New Era of Software with modern Application Security" presentation which was originally presented at LSCC (London Software Craftsmanship Community) meetup in Feb 2016.

I also reused some content and ideas from multiple blog posts previously published at http://blog.diniscruz.comments and presentations delivered at OWASP conferences

Being the first release of this book, kindly send your suggestions, criticisms, ideas or comments to dinis.cruz@owasp.org

### About the Author

Dinis Cruz is a Developer, and Application Security Engineer focused on how to develop secure applications. A key drive is on 'Automating Application Security Knowledge and Workflows' which is the main concept behind the OWASP O2 Platform and the FluentSharp APIs.

After many years (and multiple roles) Dinis is still very active at OWASP, currently heading the OWASP O2 Platform project and helping out other projects and initiatives.

After failing to scale his security knowledge, learned Git, created security vulnerabilities in code published to production servers.

He has delivered training to developers, and building multiple CI (Continuous Integration) environments; Dinis had the epiphany that the key to application security is "Secure Continuous Delivery: Developer's Immediate Connection to What They're Creating." This 'Immediate Connection/Feedback' concept is deep rooted in the development of the O2 Platform and is something that will keep Dinis busy for many years.
