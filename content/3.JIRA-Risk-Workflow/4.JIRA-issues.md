## JIRA issues

 
### The smaller, the better

For bugs and tasks, the lesser the bug, the better

Lots of small bugs and issues are high.

  - easier to code
  - easier to delegate (between developers)
  - easier to outsource
  - easier to test
  - easier to roll back
  - easier to merge into upstream or legacy branches
  - easier to deploy

It is better to put them in a special JIRA project(s) which will be focused on Quality (or Non-functional requirements)

### Capture dev knowledge when looking at code

  - it is key that when a developer is looking at code, he has the capability to create tickets for 'things noticed.'
  - for example, methods that need refactoring, complex logic, weird code, hard to visualize architecture, etc.
  - if this info/knowledge is not captured and retained, it will be lost 
  - note that the developer that notices the issue (and opens the ticket) is not able to do something about it (at that moment in time), since he will be focused on solving another bug.
  - it can be facilitated by more junior devs (or graduates/work-experience) which can take the responsibility to open and manage these tickets
    - they could even have a strategy that addresses them (with the developer being the one that merges the PRs)
