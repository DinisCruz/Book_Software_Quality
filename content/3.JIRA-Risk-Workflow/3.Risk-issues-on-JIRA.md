## Risk issues on JIRA

### Is a JIRA ticket system a security risk

  - Are they zero days?
  - Is it increasing the attack surface
  - 'If it is on fire, fix it and document it later, if not on  fire, document it.'
  - ... better to know about it and to make it explicit that it will be exposed
  - ... in reality that info already exists on JIRA (maybe not so obvious)
  - Monitoring the JIRA access could provide info about an attacker
