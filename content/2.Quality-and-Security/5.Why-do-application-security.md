## Why do application security?

- Because you care about: 
- your users
-  good engineering
- your application
- your company


You have been lucky so far due to lack of commercially focused attackers

 - This has been a Blessing and Curse
 - You are making an Hedged bet

   Your hedge bet is that :

     - the 'Security of your code' vs'Skill and motivation of attacks' will not change in next 2 years

Most of you are creating the perfect storm ….

 - User personalisation  + Digital Payments + APIs     
A large % of your apps users will have malware on their box

You are as secure as your most unexperienced developer
