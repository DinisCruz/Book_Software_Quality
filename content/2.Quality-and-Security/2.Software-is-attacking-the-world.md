# Software is eating/attacking the world


## Who is attacking you

If the attacker tells you about the attack: You should Thank them

The dangerous ones are the commercially focused criminals

It’s all about the money:

- HaaS (Hacking as an Service) - The development of Cyber Services for hire
 - HackingTeam 'rely on us' … to hack you …
 - Buy botnet  for $110
 - Shopping for Zero days - How much it cost to be an ‘internal user’
 - Services that provide '100% Anti-virus non detection guarantee' (and VirusTotal)
 - Russian Hackers Moved Ruble Rate With Malware (www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-08/russian-hackers-moved-currency-rate-with-malware-group-ib-says)

It is in the billions
 - The real criminals are running highly professional companies, with high quality software Development, Testing, QA, AB testing, etc…

Data sometimes is more important that Credit Cards
 - Ashley Madison - But the credit cards were protected

Government agencies are also starting to be an issue

  - MouseJack Attacks - How to hack a computer from  100 meters by Hijacking its Wireless Mouse or Keyboard
  - Don't accept bad certs (we have educated devs and users to blindly accept invalid certs)
  - Rubber Docky - "If quacks like a keyboard, and types like a keyboard, it must be a keyboard", "Humans use keyboards, Computers trust humans"

 - Attacking cars
   - FBI PSA (Public Service Announcement) - Motor Vehicles increasingly vulnerable to remote exploits

 - DoS (Denial of Service)
   - Syn Flood attacks
    - tools to perform it:
      - "TCP SYN flood DOS attack with hping"
      - "SYN Flooding using SCAPY and Prevention using iptables"
      - "SYN Flood DoS attack Experiments"

 - Brute force attacks
    - Login attemps (can you detect variations, can you react)

 - Attacking the cloud
    - "Bringing a machine to the Amazon" - Erik Peterson, BlackHat Europe 2014
    - "My AWS account was hackied and I have a $50,000 bill"
    - "Dev put AWS key on GitHub, Then BAD things happened"

 - Google Dorks -

    - Using 'Google Hacking Database (GHDB)' see  "Files containing passwords" for Google searches that will return them (for example wordpress DB_Password)
    - Use "Web Application" to find latest vulns (like wordpress), use google to find target, download source code of exploit (some run on metasploit)

  - Punkspider    
     - Web crawler that performs penetration tests and indexes sites based on the vulnerabilities they have.

 - Attacking the Internet of Things (IoT)
   - Shodan

 - Cyberwar
   - Stuxnet - see diagram for a good explanation of the 6 phases:
     1. infection
     2. search
     3. update
     4. compromised
     5. control
     6. deceive and destroy

- Attacking markets
  - "Russian Hackers Moved Ruble Rate With Malware"
  - "Crypto-ransomware spreads via poisoned Ads of major websites"
  - "Rogue Payday load brokers hacking websites to increase website traffic"
  - "A guys challenged hackers at defcon to hack him" - what could go wrong? :)  (the best part is the one with crying baby and the 'ninja analogy')

## Attacks coming soon

See [3.FUD-Secion.nd] for an updated version of these ideas

... you get the idea, for more examples read: 'Future Crimes' book

## TALK TALK
 - PR "Website attack affecting out customers"
 - "SQL Injection possible vector for ISP breach"
 - "How was the data stolen?" (article points to SQL Injection)
 - "TalkTalk hack. Police arrest fourth person, afed 16 years old"
 - "I was responsible for security at the time of the hack, says TalkTalk CEO Dido Harding"
 - "Harding tells parliament committee that she was accountable because cyber security is a board issue"

- Share price of TalkTalk took a hit on the day(s) of the attach

- "TalkTalk ups hacking cost to £60m - but shares rise"
    - "Ended the quarter with 101,000 fewer customers, with around 95,000 of these in direct response to attack"
    - "This resulted in the loss og around £15m in revenues, over the period, in addition to an increased estimate of between £40 - £45 for 'exceptional costs', such as consulting fees, security upgrades"

- "TalkTalk hack, MPs to hold inquiry into cyber-attack" (BBC) - {see text from inquiry (or quotes in slides)}
- "TalkTalk CEO: We underestimated the  Challenge of Cybersecurity"
 - "After police & PWC investigation TalkTalk CEO admits firm 'underestimated' cybersecurity and touts change in culture"  - "Investigation by PwC shown TalkTalk has been acting like a startup rather than a major company, (new services, innovate, move fast) and they saw security as a technology issue, not a business one and underestimated the challenge."

## Have you been Pwned

See breaches in https://haveibeenpwned.com where Troy Hunt's service collects data from data breaches (direct dumps and from pastebin)

The list of compromised websites is impressive, and as for March 2016 there were:
 - 95 pwned websites
 - 307,441,708 pwned accounts
 - 34,654 pastes
 - 25,475,091 paste accounts     

Note that this is a service provided by the 'good guys', the headline "FBI seeks hacker controlling 1.2 billion stolen logins" shows that the criminals are doing

## Bug bounties

Bug bounties are a sign of Application Security Maturity
If you don’t have one you are saying … I’m a good target to attack …

Bugcrowd and hacker one have good lists of targets

Github uses gamification and points (to make it more interesting)

Google has a good definition of what they are looking for and how much they pay for the issues reported

Event the US goverment now has a bug bounty: "The US government just launched"

## ... basically....
"Bruce Schneier: We are sleepwalking towards digital disaster and are too dumb to stop"

... but don't panic

because unless you are direcly targeted ...
... the probability of you, your company, or your apps to be attacked/targeted, is still low

... not because you are secure
... but because there are not enough attackers
... and the business model of the current attackers has not evolved to the next level  (where they find a way to make money with your assets)
