## Software is eating/attacking the world


### Who is attacking you?

If the attacker tells you about the attack: You should thank them

The dangerous ones are the commercially focused criminals

It's all about the money:

- HaaS (Hacking as a Service) - The development of Cyber Services for hire
 - HackingTeam 'rely on us' … to hack you …
<<<<<<< HEAD
 - Buy botnet for $110
 - Shopping for Zero days - How much it costs to be an ‘internal user'
 - Services that provide '100% Anti-virus non detection guarantee' (and VirusTotal)
 - Russian Hackers Moved Ruble Rate With Malware (www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-08/russian-hackers-moved-currency-rate-with-malware-group-ib-says)

It is in the billions
 - The real criminals are running highly professional companies, with high quality Software Development, Testing, QA, AB testing, etc…

Data sometimes is more important than Credit Cards
 - Ashley Madison - But the credit cards were protected

Government agencies are also starting to be an issue

 - Google Dorks -

    - Using 'Google Hacking Database (GHDB)' see  "Files containing passwords" for Google searches that will return them (for example WordPress DB_Password)
    - Use "Web Application" to find latest vulns (like wordpress), use google to find target, download source code of exploit (some run on Metasploit)

  - Punkspider    
     - Web crawler that performs penetration tests and indexes sites based on the vulnerabilities they have.

  - Attacking the Internet of Things (IoT)
    - Shodan

  - Cyberwar
    - Stuxnet - see diagram for a good explanation of the 6 phases:
       1. infection
       2. search
       3. update
       4. compromised
       5. control
       6. deceive and destroy

  - Flame
    - modular
    - shredder

  - Equation Group (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group)
    - Grayfish loader
    - Hid spyware on firmware (Hard-Disk)
      - survives operating system installs
    - impossible to remove

  - Attacking markets
    - "Russian Hackers Moved Ruble Rate With Malware"
    - "Crypto-ransomware spreads via poisoned Ads of major websites"
    - "Rogue Payday load brokers hacking websites to increase website traffic"

  - "A guys challenged hackers at DEFCON to hack him" - what could go wrong? :)  (the best part is the one with crying baby and the 'ninja analogy')

### Attacks coming soon

See [3.FUD-Secion.nd] for an updated version of these ideas

... you get the idea, for more examples read: 'Future Crimes' book

### TALK TALK
 - PR "Website attack affecting out customers."
 - "SQL Injection possible vector for ISP breach."
 - "How was the data stolen?" (article points to SQL Injection)
<<<<<<< HEAD
 - "TalkTalk hack. Police arrest fourth person, aged 16 years old"
 - "I was responsible for security at the time of the hack", says TalkTalk CEO Dido Harding"
 - "Harding tells parliament committee that she was accountable because cyber security is a board issue"

- Share price of TalkTalk took a hit on the day(s) of the attack

- "TalkTalk ups hacking cost to £60m - but shares rise"
    - "Ended the quarter with 101,000 fewer customers, with around 95,000 of these in direct response to attack"
    - "This resulted in the loss of around £15m in revenues, over the period, in addition to an increased estimate of between £40 - £45 for 'exceptional costs', such as consulting fees, security upgrades"

- "TalkTalk hack, MPs to hold inquiry into cyber-attack" (BBC) - {see text from inquiry (or quotes in slides)}
- "TalkTalk CEO: We underestimated the Challenge of Cybersecurity"
 - "After police & PWC investigation TalkTalk CEO admits firm 'underestimated' cybersecurity and touts change in culture"  - "Investigation by PWC shows TalkTalk has been acting like a startup rather than a major company, (new services, innovate, move fast) and they saw security as a technology issue, not a business one and underestimated the challenge."

### Have you been Pwned

See breaches in https://haveibeenpwned.com where Troy Hunt's service collects data from data breaches (direct dumps and from pastebin)

The list of compromised websites is impressive, and as for March 2016 there were:
 - 95 pwned websites
 - 307,441,708 pwned accounts
 - 34,654 pastes
 - 25,475,091 paste accounts     

Note that this is a service provided by the 'good guys', the headline "FBI seeks hacker controlling 1.2 billion stolen logins" shows what the criminals are doing

### Bug bounties

Bug bounties are a sign of Application Security Maturity
If you don't have one you are saying … I'm a good target to attack …

Bugcrowd and hacker one have good lists of targets

Github uses gamification and points (to make it more interesting)

Google has a good definition of what they are looking for and how much they pay for the issues reported

<<<<<<< HEAD
Even the US goverment now has a bug bounty: "The US government just launched"

### ... basically....
Bruce Schneier: "We are sleepwalking towards digital disaster and are too dumb to stop"

... but don't panic

because unless you are targeted ...
... the probability of you, your company, or your apps to be attacked/targeted, is still low

... not because you are secure
... but because there are not enough attackers
... and the business model of the current attackers has not evolved to the next level  (where they find a way to make money with your assets)

### The Ninja attacker

(from BH video - add reference)
- Q: "Are you aware that Ninja masters exist amongst us?"
- A: "Yes"
- Q: "And, are you afraid of being attacked by them in the street?"
- A: "No"
- Q: "But you know that if you were attacked, there is little you could do?"
- A: "Yes"
- Q: "Security is a bit like that unless you are targeted, you don't have much to worry."

- Good example of how to think about Software Security

### Personal digital bouncers (the future of personal security?)

- Average (not elite hackers) will need to hire protection
- more money will pay more security
<<<<<<< HEAD
- not good news for the rest of the population (the other 99%)
- 'that moment when you need to hire somebody to look after your digital identities'
 - one of the side effects of forcing the de-anonymization of users and attempts to prevent multiple identities, is that it is hard to protect personal users

- Anonymity services will become big business
- Privacy is a Human Right
