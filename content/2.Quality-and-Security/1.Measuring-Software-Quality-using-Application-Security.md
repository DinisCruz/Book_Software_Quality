## Measuring Software Quality Using Application Security

Software Craftsmanship is about Software Quality

A big problem with the Craftsmanship (and testing) community is:  ‘How to define Quality'

<<<<<<< HEAD
Everybody knows that Quality is key … but … ‘How do you measure it?'

My thesis is that Application Security can be used to define and measure Quality

Application Security is all about the non-functional requirements of software (software = apps, websites, web services, APIS, tools, build scripts = code)

Application Security is all about understanding  .HOW the software works

Using Application Security,   I can measure the quality of software

Because Application Security  measures the unintended side effects of coding


### Where are the Software Quality teams

<<<<<<< HEAD
If a Software Quality team isn't there, where is quality going to come from?

In a way, 'the Software Quality team' is a perfect partner for the AppSec team, since there are lots of similar activities which they do.

The problem is that in a lot of companies there isn't such thing as a Software Quality team, so AppSec is a backwards way to create (or kickstart it)

In fact high-level management can use Quality and Appsec to get a more realistic understanding of which teams are performing well and which ones need help. This is also a great way to measure the real impact of 'outsourced code development activities'

The problem is that in most companies there isn't such Software Quality team, so AppSec is an alternative way to create (or kickstart) it.

### No developer creates security vulnerabilities on purpose

They don't arrive Monday morning and say "Let's write some vulns today"

### "But it wasn't supposed to be used that way!!!"

- a usual comment after the original author of the "root cause" of a particular vulnerability
