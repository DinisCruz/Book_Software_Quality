## Measuring Software Quality using Application Security

Software Craftsmanship is about Software Quality

a big problem with the Craftsmanship (and testing) community is:  ‘How to define Quality?'

Everybody knows that Quality is key but ‘how to measure Quality?'

My thesis is that Application Security can be used to  define and measure Quality

Application Security is all about the non-functional requirements of software (software = apps, websites, web services, APIS, tools, build scripts = code)

Application Security is all about understanding  HOW the software works

Using Application Security,   I can measure the quality of software

Because Application Security  measures the unintended side effects of coding


### Where are the Software Quality teams

If there isn't a Software Quality team, where is quality going to come from?

In a way, the 'Software Quality team' is a perfect partner for the AppSec team, since there are lots of similar activities.

The problem is that in most companies there isn't such Software Quality team, so AppSec is an alternative way to create (or kickstart) it.

In fact, high-level management can use Quality and Appsec to get a more realistic understanding of which teams are performing well and which ones need help. This is also an excellent way to measure the real impact of 'outsourced code development activities'.

### No developer creates security vulnerabilities on purpose

They don't arrive Monday morning and say "Let's write some vulns today"

### "But it wasn't supposed to be used that way!!!"

- a usual comment after the original author of the "root cause" of a particular vulnerability
